Tutorial due yesterday
Exam 3 is Thursday, November 20
No project this week

(We start C# after fall break. The tutorial right after
break will have you install .NET so you can use VS Code for
C# development.)

Exam 3 review
- Closed notes/closed computers
- Can use full time
- Part multiple choice, part "open-ended"

Topics:
- General classes (fields, constructors, methods, creating and
    using objects)
- New keywords: static, null, instanceof, private, public,
    protected, interface, implements, extends


public class A {
    protected int x;

    public void DoStuff() {

    }

}

public class B extends A {
    //inherits everything protected and public

    public void DoStuff() {
        //method overriding
    }
}

- Arrays of objects
- Exception handling
    try/catch
    working with a file
    user input
    IOException - working with file 
    NumberFormatException - Double.parseDouble, etc.
    InputMismatchException - nextInt, nextDouble

    throwing exceptions - do in a method if you can't 
        return a value that makes sense or do the intended operation

        can throw IllegalArgumentException

- MVC architecture
    M = model (data, calculations)
    V = view (input/output)
    C = controller (intermediary between model and view)

- Inheritance, extending a class
- Method overriding
- Object class methods (toString, equals)
    

- Interfaces, implementing an interface
- Java collections (ArrayList, TreeSet, HashMap)

Work some practice problems

Lab: see started code

Goal: use HashMap to lookup/update student information by name
