real field?

rational fields?

integer fields?


Real operations:

    public Real plus(Real another) {
        
    }



Rational operations:

    public Real plus(Real another) {
        
    }


Integer operations:

    public Real plus(Real another) {
        
    }




Input is like: 
2/6+ 3/4

Then how to tell what kind of number?
