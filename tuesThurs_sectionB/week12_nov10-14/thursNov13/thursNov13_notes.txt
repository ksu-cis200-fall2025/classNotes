////////////////////////////

Project 10.

How does an interface extend another interface?

public interface SomeInterface extends AnotherInterface {

}

public class SomeClass implements SomeInterface {
    //must complete methods from SomeInterface

    //ALSO must complete methods from AnotherInterface
}


JavaDoc style

Creating random grocery order

randomly generate 4-20 items in a random configuration

use a random number generator to pick between 4-20 items

for each item, pick a random number 0-5
    0: chips
    1: apple

donuts.
    frosted/frosted
    1-12

    pick a random number that has 2 possible values
        0: frosted
        1: unfrosted    
    pick a random number 1-12: choose that many donuts

TreeSet.

How are things stored?
    NO index
    stored in sorted order
    not linear
    no duplicates

What kinds of things can be added?

What do we do to a class if we want to store those objects in a TreeSet?

///////////////////////////

Goal: TreeSet of type Person.

Sort by name, then by age

Lab.

TreeSet of Shapes. 

public interface Shape extends Comparable<Shape> {

}

Now ALL shapes must also have:

public int compareTo(Shape s) {

}

How to check if we are comparing the same types of shapes?

order first by shape type


pretend we are in Rectangle:

public int compareTo(Shape s) {
    //is s a Rectangle?
    if (s instanceof Rectangle) {
        Rectangle r = (Rectangle) s;
    }
}
