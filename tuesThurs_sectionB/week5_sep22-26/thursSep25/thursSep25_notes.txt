Project 4 due Friday

1) get list temperatures, store in array
(code is given - why can't we use technique from lab?)

2) find max difference between two adjacent days
  

3) find longest increasing section

current longest start
current longest count
loop through all days (the longest section might start with any of them)
    inner loop starting from the current day, count how many days
        the temperature keeps increasing
    is the current count better than my longest count?
        update everything

4) find most frequent temperature 

again, nested loops (similar to above)

loop through all temperatures
    inner loop to count how many times current temp appears

    update a best if needed

///////////////////////////

For-each loops

int[] arr = {5,6,7,1,2,3};


How to add up each element with a for-each loop?

int sum = 0;
for (int num : arr) {
    sum += num;
}


Can we reset each element to 0 with a for-each loop?

for (int num : arr) {
    num = 0; //won't work, can't change array like this
}

Need to use for loop to change array.


///////////////////////////

Two-dimensional arrays.

Create a 7x3 array of doubles.

double[][] grid = new double[7][3];

Initialize first row to be: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2
Initialize the second row to be: 2.0, 2.1, 2.2
...etc.

nested loops

grid.length is rows (7)
grid[i].length is cols (3)

for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
    double cur = i+1;
    for (int j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++) {
        grid[i][j] = cur;
        cur += 0.1;
    }
}

Maybe we want to score 3 exam scores each for 30 students.

--> How could we do this with a 2D array?

int students = 30;
int numTests = 3;
int[][] scores = new int[students][numTests];

--> How could we make the 10th student have exam scores 87, 76, 92?

scores[9][0] = 87;
scores[9][1] = 76;
scores[9][2] = 92;


--> How could we print the class average on exam 2?

double sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < students; i++) {
    sum += scores[i][1];
}

System.out.printf("Average on exam 2 %.2f%n", sum/students);


//////////////////////////

Lab. 

1) Create a 2D array with values 1, 2, ... that can be "read" 
like a book

2) repeatedly left-shift each row until user wants to stop


How to left-shift?
    {1,2,3,4} becomes?
    (in general) update each position to be...?

What kind of loops are needed?

(after array is built)

outer loop: menu loop asking if shift or quit
    to do a shift:
    loop through each row (i)
        use a temp to store the first element on that row
        inner loop through columns (j) to shift the current row (don't include last column)
            grid[i][j] = grid[i][j+1] 
        now put that temp value in the last spot on that row

Reminder: switching between types of input

do s.nextLine() after reading rows/columns to empty input buffer
