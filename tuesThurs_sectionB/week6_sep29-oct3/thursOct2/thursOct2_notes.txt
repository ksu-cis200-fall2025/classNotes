Project 5 due Friday

Guesses with duplicate letters.

correct: "enemy"
guess: "geese"
feedback: BYGBB

correct: "glove"
guess: "ledge"

char[] feedback (fill with B/Y/G for each guess letter)
boolean[] used (mark which of the correct letter I've already
                    matched with)

Step 1: figure out the G feedback
for each exact match, put a G at that position in feedback
    mark that same spot in used to be true

Step 2: figure out the Y/B feedback
loop through all the guess letters (i)
    if that guess letter is marked as a G, skip it 

    match = false
    loop through all correct letters (j)
        if guess[i] == correct[j] and used[j] is false  
            match = true
            set used[j] to true
            break

    if match is false, feedback[i] should be B 
    else feedback[i] should be Y

String comparison.

String s1 = (some user input);
String s2 = (some user input);


How to tell if s1 and s2 have the same characters?

if (s1 == s2) {
    //compares memory addresses, will likely return false
}

if (s1.equals(s2)) {
    //this compares character by character
}

s1 is "Apple"
s2 is "apple"


using .equals would say false (not exactly the same characters)

Instead:

if (s1.toLowerCase().equals(s2.toLowerCase())) {
    //converts both to lower
}

OR:

if (s1.equalsIgnoreCase(s2)) {
    //treats upper and lower as the same
}

How to print s1 and s2 in alphabetical order?

if (s1.compareTo(s2) < 0) {
    //read as : s1 < s2
}
else if (s1.compareTo(s2) > 0) {
    //read as : s1 > s2
}
else {
    //compareTo returns 0
    //equals would return true
}

indexOf.

String test = "explanation";

int index1 = test.indexOf("ana"); //index1 would be 4, where "ana" begins

int index2 = test.indexOf("a"); //index2 is 4, since the FIRST "a" is at spot 4

int index3 = test.indexOf("one"); //index3 is -1, since "one" is not found

int index4 = test.indexOf("a", 5); //index4 is 6 since the first "a" starting from 
                                    //position 5 is at position 6

Oct1.java example.


Get sum of comma-separated number list, like: 12,4,-3.2,5


With split?

WITHOUT split?

//////////////////////

String sample = "stuff before <p>This is a paragraph element in HTML</p> stuff after";


How to get what is between the <p> and </p> tags?

Lab 10 - see penguin.html file

<img src="emperor_penguin.jpg" alt="Emperor Penguin standing on ice">
<img alt="AdÃ©lie Penguin in the snow" src="adelie_penguin.jpg" height="100" width="200">
<script src="js/main.js"></script>

Goal: create an output file with the name of all image files (the src of an img element)


Read each line
    How can we know if we found an img tag?

    How to find the corresponding filename?

    How to look for a " ?

    s1.indexOf("\"");

    What if there are multiple image elements on the same line?
