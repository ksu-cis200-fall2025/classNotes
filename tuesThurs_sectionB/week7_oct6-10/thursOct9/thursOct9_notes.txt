Project 6 due Friday
Exam 2 is next Thursday, October 16
    (will post review material)

Connect 4.

Suppose we have:

    public static char[][] board;
    public static final int ROWS = 6;
    public static final int COLS = 7;


User enters a column number. How do we tell if it is full?

board[0][user input column] is not empty, then the column is full



How do we "drop" a piece in the column?

    loop backwards up the column
    for (int i = ROWS-1; i >= 0; i--) {
        see if board[i][user input column] is empty.
            if it is, put the piece there and break.
    }



How do we check for a winner?

four in a row 
    for (int i = 0; i < ROWS; i++) {
        //loop through possible leftmost values on that row
        for (int j = 0; j < COLS-3; j++) {
            see if board[i][j], board[i][j+1], 
                board[i][j+2], board[i][j+3] all match a piece
        }
    }


four in a column  (similar)


four on \ diagonal
    nested loop over possible upper-left starts of \
        see if board[i][j], board[i+1][j+1],
            board[i+2][j+2], board[i+3][j+3]


four on / diagonal

Reorganizing code into methods.

- Identify repeated code

- Identify related code that can be "chunked"

- Goals: 
    - methods aren't much longer than a screen
    - can easily see program flow from the main method
    - no duplicate code



Example: reorganize project 5 (Wordle) into methods
