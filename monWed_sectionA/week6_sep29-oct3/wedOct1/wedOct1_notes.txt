Project 5 due Friday

Guesses with duplicate letters.

correct: "enemy"
guess: "geese"
feedback: BYGBB

correct: "quite"
guess: "nerve"
feedback: BBBBBG

char[] feedback (will fill with B/Y/B values)
boolean[] used that starts at false, is matched with the letters
    in the correct word, gets set to true when I've already accounted
    for that letter in the guess

loop through your guess letters 
    see if the current guess letter should be a G 
    if it should, put a G at that spot and mark that spot used

now find Y/B values
loop through each guess letter (i)
    if it's marked G, skip
    else 
        found = false
        loop through each correct letter (j)
            if guess[i] == correct[j] and used[j] is still false
                found = true
                used[j] = true
                break

        if found is false, the feedback is B 
        else feedback is Y

String comparison.

String s1 = (some user input);
String s2 = (some user input);


How to tell if s1 and s2 have the same characters?

if (s1 == s2) {
    //compares memory addresses, will probably say false
}

if (s1.equals(s2)) {
    //compares the characters
}

"Apple" and "apple" would be NOT equal 

if (s1.toLowerCase().equals(s2.toLowerCase())) {
    //compares both values as lower case 
}

OR 

if (s1.equalsIgnoreCase(s2)) {
    //would say "Apple" and "apple" are equal
}


How to print s1 and s2 in alphabetical order?

if (s1.compareTo(s2) < 0) {
    //if s1 comes alphabetically before s2
    //think of s1 < s2
}
else if (s1.compareTo(s2) > 0) {
    //if s1 comes alphabetically after s2
    //think of s1 > s2
}
else {
    //the two are alphabetically equal
    //compareTo returns 0
}


/////////////////////

indexOf.

String test = "explanation";

int index1 = test.indexOf("ana"); //index1 is 4, where "ana" begins
int index2 = test.indexOf("a"); //index2 is 4, where the FIRST "a" begins
int index3 = test.indexOf("one"); //index3 will be -1, since "one" isn't found
int index4 = test.indexOf("a", 5); //index4 is 6, which is the first "a" AFTER index 5

//////////////////////

Oct1.java example.


Get sum of comma-separated number list, like: 12,4,-3.2,5


With split?

WITHOUT split?

//////////////////////

String sample = "stuff before <p>This is a paragraph element in HTML</p> stuff after";


How to get what is between the <p> and </p> tags?

Lab 10 - see penguin.html file

<img src="emperor_penguin.jpg" alt="Emperor Penguin standing on ice">
<img alt="AdÃ©lie Penguin in the snow" src="adelie_penguin.jpg" height="100" width="200">
<script src="js/main.js"></script>

Goal: create an output file with the name of all image files (the src of an img element)


Read each line
    How can we know if we found an img tag?

    How to find the corresponding filename?

    How to look for a " ?
        search for "\""
