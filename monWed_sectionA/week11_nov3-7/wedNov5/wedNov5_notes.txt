Project 9 due Friday

RealNumber, RationalNumber, IntegerNumber

real: numbers with decimals
rational: fraction
integer: whole number

real field? double for the number (val)

rational fields? int for numerator, denominator

integer fields? int for the number


RealNumber operations:

    public RealNumber plus(RealNumber another) {
        result is a real

        double result = val + another.val;
        return new RealNumber(result);
    }



RationalNumber operations:

    public RealNumber plus(RealNumber another) {
        if (another instanceof RationalNumber) {
            //we are adding two rationals

            RationalNumber otherRat = (RationalNumber) another;

            int comDenom = denom*otherRat.denom;
            int newNum = num*otherRat.denom + other.num*denom;

            return new RationalNumber(newNum, comDenom);
        }
        return super.plus(another);
    }


IntegerNumber operations:

    public RealNumber plus(RealNumber another) {
        //is another an IntegerNumber? cast it and make result an integer

    }




Input is like: 
2/6+ 3/4
0.57 -4



What to look for first?

look for the operator (+, -, or *)
use substring to grab on either side


String str = "  2/3";
String small = str.trim(); //"2/3"





Then how to tell what kind of number?
    / in rationals
    . in reals


How to tell if invalid?

apple + 3/4


String front = "apple";
int val = Integer.parseInt(front);

if not an integer, when I parse it will throw an exception

use a try/catch

enums

public enum DayOfWeek {
    Monday,
    Tuesday,
    Wednesday,
    Thursday,
    Friday,
    Saturday,
    Sunday
}


DayOfWeek day = DayOfWeek.Monday;
