Why define general classes?

Parts of a general class:

field - whatever information they need to store about themselves
    (length/width for a rectangle)
constructor - sets up a new one of these types, takes in information
    to initialize the fields
operations / methods (area/perimeter)


////////////////////////

Example: complete the Circle class

Create objects, call methods

////////////////////////

Example: *start* the Fraction class

Lab 14 instructions:

1) Write General "Point" class 
    - Fields: x and y coordinate (doubles)
    - Constructor to initialize fields 
    - print method (prints like "(0.53, 6.00)")
    - midpoint method (takes another Point as a parameter, 
        returns the midpoint between this point and the parameter)
    - quadrant method: returns 1,2,3, or 4
        1: upper-right
        2: upper-left
        3: lower-left
        4: lower-right

2) Write Lab14 class with main method
    - Create the point (-2, 7)
    - Get user input for the coordinates for a second point, 
        create that point
    - Print both points
    - Get the midpoint between those two points and print it
    - Get (and print) the quadrant of the two points 
        and the midpoint
