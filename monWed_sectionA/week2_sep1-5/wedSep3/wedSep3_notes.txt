Video tutorial due yesterday (hopefully you've already done it)

Try to do tutorials before first lab of the week
    (usually they will be due on Monday)

Lab 3: today

Project 2: Friday, September 5

/////////////////

Week 3 (next week):

- background reading
- video tutorial due Monday
- labs Mon/Wed
- project due Friday

/////////////////

int x = 0;

if (x < 10) {
    System.out.println("one");
}
else if (x < 20) {
    System.out.println("two");
}


What prints? one

(doesn't check else if condition at all since the if was true)

/////////////////


if (y > 0) {
    if (y < 10) {
        System.out.println("here");
    }
}

--> is this OK? is there a way to simplify?

if (y > 0 && y < 10) {
    System.out.println("here");
}

///////////////////

Suppose "num" is a user input.

    if (num < 3) {
        double price = num*5.99;
    }
    else {
        double price = num*3.99;
    }
    System.out.printf("Total is: $%.2f%n", price);





What is this trying to do? calculate price

Will it compile? no. the price variables in the if/else 
    have a variable scope just in their if{} and else{}. We can't 
    see them afterwards.

Here is a fixed fragment:

Suppose "num" is a user input.

    double price;
    if (num < 3) {
        price = num*5.99;
    }
    else {
        price = num*3.99;
    }
    System.out.printf("Total is: $%.2f%n", price);




////////////////////

Variable scope.

{
    type name;

}

visible inside {} where declared


////////////////////

Assume "x" is a user input.


    int answer;

    //this print won't compile, answer isn't initialized
    System.out.println(answer);

    if (x < 0) {
        answer = 7;
    }
    else if (x >= 0) { 
        answer = 14;
    }

    System.out.printf("Answer is: %d%n", answer);


What is this trying to do? Will it compile?
    won't compile - compiler thinks answer might not have
    been initialized. Could be fixed by making the else if an else
    or by giving answer an initial value


--> rules for initializing variables

variable must be initialized before it can be used


////////////////////////

suppose "grade" is a user input (A/B/etc.)

switch(grade) {
    case 'A':
    case 'B':
    case 'C':
        System.out.println("Meets standard");
        break;
    case 'D':
    case 'F':
        System.out.println("Doesn't meet standard");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Invalid option");
        break;
}




What is the "break" for? leaves switch

Is there a way to simplify?
    above is the simplification


How could we have done the same thing with an if/else if?

if (grade == 'A' || grade == 'B' || grade == 'C') {

}

////////////////////////

Example: bags of chips are buy one get one free at the store.
Full price is $5.99 each.

Customers are limited to 10 bags total.

(is there any other input that would be invalid?)

////////////////////////

Look at Project 2.

get income
keep taxTotal (start at 0), which is the sum of tax calculations

subtract 14,600 from your income

if (income > 609351) {
    //37% bracket

    amountToTax = income - 609351
    taxTotal += amountToTax * 0.37

    //adjust income to just be amount left to tax
    income = 609351
}
other if-statements corresponding to each case

////////////////////////

Look at Lab 3.
