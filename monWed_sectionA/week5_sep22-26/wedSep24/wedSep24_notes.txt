Project 4 due Friday

1) get list temperatures, store in array
(code is given - why can't we use technique from lab?)


2) find max difference between two adjacent days

keep the max difference so far 
loop over each, find difference between that one and and next one   
    see if better than the max so far


3) find longest increasing section 

track: best beginning temperature so far, length of longest section so far

want nested loops
outer loop steps through each temperature (b/c increasing section might begin there)
    inner loop steps through for current temperature how long it increase

    is my most recent count longer than my best? update my best info


4) find most frequent temperature 

similar to #3. nested loops.
outer loop: consider that each temp might be the most frequent
    inner loop: count how many times the current temp appears


///////////////////////////

For-each loops

int[] arr = {5,6,7,1,2,3};


How to add up each element with a for-each loop?

int sum = 0;
for (int cur : arr) {
    sum += cur;
}



Can we reset each element to 0 with a for-each loop?

for (int cur : arr) {
    arr[cur]
}

Doesn't work, cur isn't actually the array.
Have to use regular for loop to change array.

///////////////////////////

Two-dimensional arrays.

Create a 7x3 array of doubles.

Initialize first row to be: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2
Initialize the second row to be: 2.0, 2.1, 2.2
...etc.


double[][] grid = new double[7][3];
for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
    double num = i+1;
    for (int j = 0; j < grid[i].length; i++) {
        grid[i][j] = num;
        num += 0.1;
    }
}

Maybe we want to score 3 exam scores each for 30 students.

--> How could we do this with a 2D array?

int[][] examScores = new int[30][3];

rows: students
columns: exams


--> How could we make the 10th student have exam scores 87, 76, 92?

examScores[9][0] = 87;
examScores[9][1] = 76;
examScores[9][2] = 92;



--> How could we print the class average on exam 2?

double sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < examScores.length; i++) {
    sum += examScores[i][1];
}

System.out.printf("Average: %.2f%n", sum/examScores.length);

Lab. 

1) Create a 2D array with values 1, 2, ... that can be "read" like a book

2) repeatedly left-shift each row until user wants to stop


How to right-shift?
    {1,2,3,4} becomes?
    (in general) update each position to be...?

What kind of loops are needed?


once you have all the input:

outer loop: do-while with menu
    inner loop 1: loop through all rows
        inner loop 2: loop through cols, do the shifting

            will need to use a temp to not lose the front value


How to get the spacing? \t

Reminder: switching between types of input
    after getting the two dimensions, do:

    s.nextLine();
