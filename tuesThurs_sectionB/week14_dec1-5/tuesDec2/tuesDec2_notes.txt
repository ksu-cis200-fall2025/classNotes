Tutorial due yesterday (this is the last tutorial)
Labs today and Thursday
Project 11 due Friday (this is the last project)

**We will still have two labs next week to practice
graphical development in C#, but no tutorial or project.

/////////////////////////////////

High: 50/50 (4 students)
Average: 36/50 (artificially low, since several

**How to use "what if" in Canvas

Final exam assignment

Midterm equivalent from final exam assignment (in Midterms category)

Example: what if I got an 80/100 on the final?
    plug into midterm equivalent: 40/50

////////////////////////

Today: start C#

////////////////////////

Reminder: make console app to get age, print it back out

/////////////////////////

Variables/operations?
    string is lowercase
    bool instead of boolean

Input/output?

Conditional statements?

Loops?
    foreach has different syntax

Arrays?
    int[] nums = new int[4];
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++)

    foreach (int x in nums)


strings?
    string str = "hello";
    char letter = str[0];
    int len = str.Length;


(skip files for now)

Methods? capitalize method names by convention

General classes?
    same, but now have properties

Exceptions?

    try {
        //code that might cause problems
    }
    catch (FormatException) {
        //handle problem
    }

//////////////////////////

Properties.

Make Person class with name/age

- first use fields, getters/setters
- then use properties

--> create objects, use properties

- autoproperty syntax
- restrict age to be 0-120
- add Birthday method
- make it so can only change age inside Person


--> remove constructor
--> make name/age only able to be initialized

///////////////////////////

Lab 23. 

Convert shift cipher (lab 16) to C#

string, StringBuilder differences

.Append
.ToString


Lab 16 solution is in classNotes repo if you don't have it
