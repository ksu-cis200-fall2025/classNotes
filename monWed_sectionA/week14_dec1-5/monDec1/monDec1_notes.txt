Tutorial due tonight (this is the last tutorial)
Labs today and Wednesday
Project 11 due Friday (this is the last project)

**We will still have two labs next week to practice
graphical development in C#, but no tutorial or project.

/////////////////////////////////

Exam 3 results

High: 50/50 (4 students)
Average: 36/50 (artificially low, since several
    elected not to take exam 3)

A (45-50): 9 students
B (40-44): 7 students
C (35-39): 7 students
D (30-34): 3 students
F (below 30): 8 students (including 3 zeroes)


**Midterm equivalent from final
    example: plug in 80/100 on the final
    ALSO plug in 40/50 on the midterm equivalent

**How to use "what if" in Canvas

////////////////////////

Today: start C#

////////////////////////

Reminder: make Hello, world console app

Variables/operations?

boolean -> bool
String -> string
int, double, char - the same


Input/output?




Conditional statements?
    if, if/else, if/else if, switch
    SAME


Loops?
    for, for each, while, do-while
    only for each is different

Arrays?
    int[] nums = new int[10];

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++) {
        
    }

Java:    for (int name : nums)

C#: foreach (int name in nums)


strings?
    string str = "hello";
    in Java: char first = str.charAt(0);
    in Java: int len = str.length();

    in C#: char first = str[0];
    in C#: int len = str.Length;


(skip files for now)

Methods?
    exactly the same 
    convention to capitalize method names

General classes?
    exactly the same

Exceptions?

in Java:
try {
    //something
}
catch (InputMismatchException ie) {
    //do something
}


in C#:
try {
    //something
}
catch (FormatException) {
    //do something
}

//////////////////////////

Properties.

Make Person class with name/age

- first use fields, getters/setters
- then use properties

--> create objects, use properties

- autoproperty syntax
- restrict age to be 0-120
- add Birthday method
- make it so can only change age inside Person


--> remove constructor
--> make name/age only able to be initialized

///////////////////////////

Lab 23. 

Convert shift cipher (lab 16) to C#

string, StringBuilder differences

StringBuilder: 
    using System.Text;

    Append
    ToString

nullables

Lab 16 solution is in classNotes repo if you don't have it
