Project 10 due Friday (last Java project)

Exam 3 is Wednesday, November 19
- will post exam information
- will do short review Monday, November 17

Will start C# after fall break

////////////////////////////

Project 10.

How does an interface extend another interface?

(maybe Another is some other interface)

public interface Name extends Another {

}

if a class implements Name:
    - must include all methods from Name
    - also must include all methods from Another


JavaDoc style

Creating random grocery order

pick 4-20 items 
for each item, pick a random combination

use random number generator to figure out number between 4-20
for each one you want to randomly generate
    want a random number 0-5
        0: Apple
        1: Chips
        etc.

maybe random donut
    random number with 2 possible values: 0 frosted, 1 unfrosted
    random number for possible counts



////////////////////////////

TreeSet.
    sorts items
    does not allow duplicates

How are things stored? sorted order

What kinds of things can be added? things we can sorted

compareTo
    -1 if this object came before param
    0 if this object equals param
    1 if this object comes after parm



What do we do to a class if we want to store those objects in a TreeSet?

///////////////////////////

Goal: TreeSet of type Person.

First, make TreeSet with current Person


Next: Sort by name, then by age

///////////////////////////

Lab.

How to check if we are comparing the same types of shapes?

Note: really should override equals when using TreeSet, but we'll ignore


public int compareTo(Shape s) {
    //if we are in the Rectangle class
    if (s instanceof Rectangle) {
        //comparing two rectangles
    }
    else {
        //you know the shapes are different types
        //compare their names
    }
}
