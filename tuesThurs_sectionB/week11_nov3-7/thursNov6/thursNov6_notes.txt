Project 9 due Friday

RealNumber, RationalNumber, IntegerNumber

top class: RealNumber
RationalNumber extend RealNumber
IntegerNumber extend RationalNumber


real field?
    double

rational fields?
    ints for numerator and denominator


integer fields?
    int for num


RealNumber operations:

RealNumber one = new RealNumber(3.2);
RealNumber two = new RealNumber(4.5);
RealNumber added = one.plus(two);

    public RealNumber plus(RealNumber another) {
        //val, another.val

        return new RealNumber(val + another.val);
    }



RationalNumber operations (override from RealNumber):

    public RealNumber plus(RealNumber another) {
        if (another instanceof RationalNumber) {
            RationalNumber other = (RationalNumber) another;

            int newNum = (find this from num, denom, other.num, other.denom);
            int newDenom = (find this from num, denom, other.num, other.denom);

            return new RationalNumber(newNum, newNum);
        }
        else {
            //another is real
            return super.plus(another);
        }
    }


IntegerNumber operations:

    public RealNumber plus(RealNumber another) {
        //check if another is an IntegerNumber
        //if it is, construct and return a new IntegerNumber

        otherwise, call super
    }




Input is like: 
2/6+ 3/4
0.57 -4



What to look for first? look for operator (+, -, or *)

use substring to get the two number pieces on either side

String piece = "0.57 ";
String trimmed = piece.trim(); //"0.57"


Then how to tell what kind of number?

real number? look for decimal
    Double.parseDouble

rational number? look for slash
    break apart numerator and denominator

no slash or decimal? integer


How to tell if invalid?

0.57 + apple


use a try/catch when doing your converting to double/int

enums

public enum DayOfWeek {
    Monday,
    Tuesday,
    Wednesday,
    Thursday,
    Friday,
    Saturday,
    Sunday
}

DayOfWeek day = DayOfWeek.Monday;
