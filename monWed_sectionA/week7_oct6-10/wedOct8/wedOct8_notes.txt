Project 6 due Friday
Exam 2 is next Wednesday, October 15
    (will post review material)

Connect 4.

Suppose we have this game board and these dimensions:

    public static char[][] board;
    public static final int ROWS = 6;
    public static final int COLS = 7;


User enters a column number. How do we tell if it is full?

see if top of column has something in it
board[0][user input col]


How do we "drop" a piece in the column?

loop backward up that column

for (int i = ROWS-1; i >= 0; i--) {
    see if board[i][user input col] if empty
        if it is, put my piece there
        break;
}



How do we check for a winner?
    4 in a row 
    4 in a column 
    4 diagonally \ and /


Check 4 in a row.

for (int i = 0; i < ROWS; i++) {
    loop over possible STARTS of 4 on that row
    for (int j = 0; j <= COLS - 4; j++) {
        see if board[i][j], board[i][j+1], 
            board[i][j+2], board[i][j+3] are all the same (and not empty)
    }
}


for diagonals, use nested loops to loop over possible starting
positions

(say, possible top left corners for \ diagonal)

compare [i][j], [i+1][j+1], [i+2][j+2], [i+3][j+3]

Reorganizing code into methods.

- Identify repeated code

- Identify related code that can be "chunked"

- Goals: 
    - methods aren't much longer than a screen
    - can easily see program flow from the main method
    - no duplicate code



Example: reorganize project 5 (Wordle) into methods
